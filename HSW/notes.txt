Model 1. Independent and Additive Firing:
- looking at each cell type as an additive onto place cells, with spikes randomly distributed in each tebc trial,
does not result in good conditioning separation when training using cebra
- this is in the file tebc_response2_additive.py

Model 2. Dependent Interaction/Multiplicative Interaction:
- making each modification from TEBC a function of existing place cell firing-- ie firing rate might double from baseline
instead of just being an additive of a single number
- giving results much more in line with expected but not sure if the mechanism makes sense, esp for decreasing firing rates


-- need place cell model where when animal is still, only cells with place fields in that location fire, all other cells decrease firing?
-- when animal is moving, only cells with place fields in that location respond




PAPERS OF NOTE
"This suggests that the primary role of the hippocampus in associative learning may not be to encode that the CS predicts the US,
but rather to encode that the CS is followed by the US when the rat is in a specific location or context "
- Hippocampal Place Cells Acquire Location-Specific Responses to the Conditioned Stimulus during Auditory Fear Conditioning

hese results provide compelling evidence that hippocampal neurons represent information related to specific perceptual,
cognitive and behavioural events not tied to a particular spatial location. Furthermore, the range of specificity varied from
many cells that encode single, frequently experienced events, such as a place or an odour, to a few cells encoding unique
conjunctions that reflect a rare event, such as a specific odour appearing as a ‘match’ in a particular place.

-------
--> Independent and Additive Firing:
Description: Two types of firing are independent and additive. For example, a place cell in its field firing at 2Hz and a 1Hz response to TEBC results in a combined 3Hz response.
Neuroscience Basis: Separate synaptic inputs for spatial and TEBC information converge on hippocampal neurons, like CA1 pyramidal cells, but act independently and sum their effects.

--> Dependent Interaction:
Description: The two types of firing are not independent. The firing rate due to TEBC depends on the original place cell firing rate, possibly doubling or halving it.
Neuroscience Basis: Synaptic inputs for TEBC and spatial information interact at the dendritic level of hippocampal neurons, where the response to one input influences the other.

--> Multiplicative Interaction:
Description: The response to TEBC could exponentially scale with the firing rate of the place cell, suggesting a non-linear interaction.
Neuroscience Basis: Nonlinear synaptic integration within hippocampal neurons, possibly through mechanisms like NMDA receptor dynamics.

Threshold Modulation:
Description: The response to TEBC might only affect the firing rate if it crosses a certain threshold.
Neuroscience Basis: Voltage-gated ion channels in hippocampal neurons modify excitability, responsive to TEBC only above a specific membrane potential threshold.
Modeling Approach: Introduce a threshold parameter in your model. The place cell's response to TEBC would only alter
its firing rate if the TEBC signal or the place cell's current firing rate crosses this threshold. You can implement this
by using conditional statements in your model that check whether the firing rate or TEBC signal exceeds a predefined threshold,
after which the firing rate is modulated.

Temporal Integration:
Description: The cell integrates signals over time, depending on the history of both place and TEBC-related firing.
Neuroscience Basis: Synaptic mechanisms like short-term plasticity in hippocampal neurons, where past activity influences current synaptic strength.

--> Context-Dependent Modulation:
Description: The interaction between place and TEBC firing might be context-dependent, varying in different states.
Neuroscience Basis: Modulatory inputs from other brain regions that alter synaptic plasticity or neuron excitability in the hippocampus.
Hebbian and Anti-Hebbian Mechanisms:

Description: The principles of Hebbian learning and its counterpart, anti-Hebbian mechanisms, determine how synaptic strengths are adjusted.
Neuroscience Basis: Adjustments in synaptic strength through LTP and LTD at specific synapses in hippocampal neurons.

Neuromodulatory Influence:
Description: Neuromodulators like dopamine or acetylcholine modulate the interaction between TEBC and place cell firing.
Neuroscience Basis: The release of neuromodulators affects synaptic plasticity, neuron excitability, and signal transduction pathways within hippocampal neurons.

Plasticity-Dependent Changes:
Description: The interaction between place cell and TEBC firing changes with learning, involving LTP or LTD.
Neuroscience Basis: Long-term changes in synaptic strength and neuronal properties in response to learning, mediated by molecular changes.

Network-Level Interactions:
Description: Different populations of neurons interact to produce emergent properties not evident when considering single neurons alone.
Neuroscience Basis: Complex interactions between different neuron types and layers within the hippocampus, involving subregions like CA1, CA3, and the dentate gyrus.
